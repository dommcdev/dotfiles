# To-do
When right click open file in vim, closing vim is slow with super+c
Add pacman stuff to install script (lizardbyte repo + pacman hook for theme)
Some fancy zsh thing that makes everything case-insensitive
Make ctrl+[ remap happen at a lower level

# BUGS
Using regular Linux kernel results in shutdown hangs. Switching to lts kernel fixes this
Running Chrome via Wayland results in video acceleration being not supported on my old gpu. Switch to x11 to fix
PWAs start in floating mode when starting in Xwayland. Custom window rule fixes this (somewhat?)
