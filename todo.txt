# To-do
[Finish install script]
When right click open file in vim, closing vim is slow with super+c
Make ctrl+[ remap happen at a lower level (+ tap for reg escape)
Rework dotbot to use advanced conf for sudo (add grub, sddm, pacman files)
--plan - remove install.conf-yaml eventually, remove shell.sh eventually. Back to my original plan or no mega-install script - just small pieces. 
Screenshot tweaks (click to open in viewer)
Add tmux-resurrect to tmux conf, also tmux-sessionizer, way to define configs for projects
