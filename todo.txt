# To-do
Install script setup (custom iso with pre-install script?)
When right click open file in vim, closing vim is slow with super+c
Add workspace rules so gimp always opens full in new workspace
Add pacman stuff to install script (lizardbyte repo + pacman hook for theme)


# BUGS
Using regular Linux kernel results in shutdown hangs. Switching to lts kernel fixes this
Running Chrome via Wayland results in video acceleration being not supported on my old gpu. Switch to x11 to fix
PWAs start in floating mode when starting in Xwayland. Custom window rule fixes this (somewhat?)
