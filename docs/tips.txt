Applying cursor theme
On Hyprland, simply place the hyprcursor in ~/.local/share/icons/ and it will automatically be picked up. If you have multiple, set the HYPRCURSOR_THEME and HYPRCURSOR_SIZE env vars in your hyprland conf/uwsm-hyprland file. 

Applying icon theme
Gsettings (icon-theme) works for things like nautilus, but the gtk-4.0/settings.ini is needed for things like rofi (although rofi has a line for icon theme in its config).
