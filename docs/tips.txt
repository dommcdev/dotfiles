cp command
    When copying *folders*, cp is NOT idempotent.
    cp src/ dest/ will clone src and rename as dest on a first run,
    but create dest/src on the second run
    use rsync -a src/ dest/ instead, but keep in mind src/ copies contents of src,
    while src (no trailing /) copies the folder itself

Connecting to edurom (impala)
    Use PEAP. For identity put full email; for phase2 identity put full email; for phase2 password put your stmu password. Leave phase2 method as mschapv2, and leave server domain mask, ca cert, client cert, client key, and key passphrase empty. You will be prompted to enter username/password - enter stmu email/password (again).
